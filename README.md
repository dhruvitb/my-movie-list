# My Movie List

A movie app that's loosely based off MyAnimeList. Users can search for films, see what's popular right now, and compile a list of movies they've watched (along
with their own reviews for said movies).

# TODO
- [ ] Make a repository to cache results (remote mediator needed) - top/search doesn't change often so data is valid for a while
- [ ] UI needs big upgrade
- [ ] Better navigation actions
- [ ] Edit your movie list
